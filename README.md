# GestureShapes
- Readings of Acceleromter, Gyroscope, Light, Pedometer/Step Counter, Proximity, and pressure sensors.
* These readings can be used a reference in the case where sensor event values manipulation is required. 
- With every touch event on the screen, a toast pops up distinguishing the touch event.
- Bonus: A ball bound to the display resolution that moves according the accelerometer titl events.
- Activity 2 is for advanced gestures, and needs polishing...
- Random functionality tests in general.
